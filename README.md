Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard is a powerful tool built to help HR departments and management understand employee attrition patterns. By presenting complex data in an intuitive visual format, it enables quick identification of high-risk groups, the impact of various factors (like salary, education, age, and job role) on attrition, and facilitates proactive strategies to improve employee retention.

Features
Interactive Visualizations: Explore attrition trends through dynamic charts and graphs.

Key Attrition Drivers: Analyze the correlation between attrition and various factors such as:

Salary Slab

Years at Company

Education Level

Age Group

Job Role

Drill-down Capabilities: (Assumed based on dashboard design) Potentially drill down into specific segments for deeper analysis.

Clear Data Presentation: Easy-to-understand representation of complex HR data.

Dashboard Components
Based on the provided screenshot, the dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

Attrition by Salary Slab: A bar chart showing the count of attrition across different salary ranges (Upto 5k, 5k-10k, 10k-15k, 15k+).

Attrition by Years At Company: A line or area chart illustrating the distribution of attrition based on the number of years employees have spent at the company.

JobRole Summary Table: A table providing a summary of different job roles, potentially showing the sum of job level and job involvement. (Note: The column headers are partially visible and interpreted.)

Attrition by Education: A donut chart displaying the percentage and count of attrition across different education levels.

Attrition by AgeGroup: A bar chart showing attrition counts for various age groups (e.g., 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 18-25, 55+).

Attrition by JobRole: A horizontal bar chart depicting the count of attrition for different job roles (e.g., Sales Executive, Research Scientist, Laboratory Technician, Manufacturing Director, Healthcare Representative, Sales Representative, Manager, Human Resources).

Technologies Used
This dashboard is likely built using a business intelligence (BI) tool. Common tools that can create such dashboards include:

Power BI (Highly likely, given the visual style)

Tableau

QlikView / Qlik Sense

Google Looker Studio

Python (with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash)

R (with libraries like ggplot2, Shiny)

To be specific, please replace with the actual technology you used, e.g.:
